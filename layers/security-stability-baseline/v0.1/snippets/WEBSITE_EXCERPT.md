# Security & Stability Baseline (Excerpt)

Most AI failures are not loud. They are quiet: boundary creep, hidden assumptions, and invisible responsibility shifts.

- explicit decision boundaries (B0–B3)
- predictable escalation paths
- verification hooks for high-impact actions
- a calm, design-only kill-switch model
