# Operator Card — KILL SWITCH (Design-only)

## Purpose
Stop execution safely without creating chaos or losing learning value.

## A kill switch is successful when it is boring.

## Do
- stop execution immediately
- preserve minimal evidence
- hand off to a human owner
- resume only with explicit confirmation

## Avoid
- dramatic shutdowns
- state loss
- unclear responsibility after stopping

## Reminder
A kill switch is a **state transition**, not a panic button.
