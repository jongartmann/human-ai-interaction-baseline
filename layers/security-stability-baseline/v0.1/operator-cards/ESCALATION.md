# Operator Card — ESCALATION

## Purpose
Ensure high-impact decisions are owned by the right human.

## Escalate when
- permissions / identity / access are affected
- money / billing / procurement is involved
- safety / legal / compliance impact exists
- policies or operating rules change
- evidence is insufficient for safe action

## Output shape
1) Summary (3–5 bullets)  
2) Decision boundary (“requires human owner because…”)  
3) Minimum info needed to decide  
4) Options (only if evidence supports them)

## Avoid
- vague “ask your manager” messages
- escalation without a usable brief
