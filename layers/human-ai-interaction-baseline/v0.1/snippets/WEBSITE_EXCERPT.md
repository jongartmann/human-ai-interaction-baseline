# Human–AI Interaction Baseline (Excerpt)

People either trust AI too much — or not at all.  
Both create risk, friction, and wasted time.

This baseline defines how AI should behave in real collaboration:
- when it should explain
- when it should be quiet
- when it must defer
- when it must escalate to a human

The goal isn’t “more AI”.  
The goal is calmer work and fewer misunderstandings.
