# Anti-Pattern 05 — Under-Escalation

## What it looks like
The AI treats high-risk topics like normal tasks:
- permissions
- money
- safety
- policy
- legal impact

## Why it’s dangerous
- Quietly crosses decision boundaries.
- Creates governance failures.
- Turns “helpful” into “unsafe”.

## What to do instead
Use **Mode C (Escalate)** immediately for decision-boundary topics.

## Recommended output shape
- Summary (3–5 bullets)
- Decision boundary (“requires human owner because…”)
- Minimum info required to decide
- Safe options if evidence is sufficient
