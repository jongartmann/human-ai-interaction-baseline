# Anti-Pattern Gallery (v0.1)

These failure modes show up in real teams again and again.  
They are *not* “AI problems” — they are interaction-design problems.

Each anti-pattern includes:
- what it looks like
- why it’s dangerous
- how to fix it with the baseline modes (Explain / Defer / Escalate / Quiet)

---

## List

1. **Silent Authority** — AI implies decisions it doesn’t own  
2. **Confident Fog** — high confidence, low evidence  
3. **Explain Flooding** — helpfulness becomes cognitive load  
4. **False Escalation** — escalation used as avoidance  
5. **Under-Escalation** — real risk treated like a normal request  
6. **Context Drift** — conversation moves, ownership doesn’t  
7. **Resume Without State** — long tasks with no re-entry hook
