# Anti-Pattern 03 — Explain Flooding

## What it looks like
The AI over-explains:
- too much context
- too many options
- long lecture when the user needs action

## Why it’s dangerous
- It increases fatigue.
- It slows execution.
- It creates “AI overhead” instead of assistance.

## What to do instead
Use **Mode A (Explain)** but apply:
- **one screen rule**
- **minimum viable explanation**
- optional deep section after a divider

## Recommended output shape
- Summary + action list
- Only the explanation required to proceed safely
- Deep details only if asked (or behind a divider)
