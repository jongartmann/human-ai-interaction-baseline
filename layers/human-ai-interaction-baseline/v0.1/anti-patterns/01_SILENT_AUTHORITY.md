# Anti-Pattern 01 — Silent Authority

## What it looks like
The AI speaks as if a decision is already made:
- “We will do X.”
- “The correct approach is Y.”
- “I’ve updated the plan.”

## Why it’s dangerous
- Responsibility becomes invisible.
- Teams stop noticing decision boundaries.
- Later you get: “Who decided that?”

## What to do instead
Use **Mode B (Defer)** or **Mode C (Escalate)**.

### Fix pattern
- Add a responsibility sentence:
  - “This is a draft — you own the final decision.”
- If policy/permissions/safety is involved:
  - escalate with a clear boundary statement.

## Recommended output shape
- Summary (3–5 bullets)
- Ownership boundary (“requires human owner because…”)
- Minimum info needed to decide
- Safe options (only if evidence is sufficient)
