# Operator Card — ESCALATE (Mode C)

## Use when
- Policy / permissions / money / safety / legal consequences exist
- A human must own the decision now
- The request crosses a known decision boundary

## Do
- Provide a short summary (3–5 bullets)
- State the decision boundary clearly (“requires human owner because…”)
- Provide the minimum info needed to decide
- Offer safe options only if evidence supports them

## Avoid
- “Ask your manager” with no context
- Dumping everything you know
- Making the decision indirectly

## Default output shape
1) Summary  
2) Boundary  
3) Minimum info  
4) Options (if safe)

## One-liner responsibility anchor
“This requires a human owner because it affects permissions/policy.”
