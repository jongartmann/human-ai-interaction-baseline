## Baselines Suite (v0.1)

**Two artifact-only layers are live — and they are inside this repo** (not separate repositories):

- **Human–AI Interaction Baseline** → layers/human-ai-interaction-baseline/v0.1/BASELINE.md
  - Anti-patterns: layers/human-ai-interaction-baseline/v0.1/anti-patterns/ANTI_PATTERNS.md
  - Operator cards: layers/human-ai-interaction-baseline/v0.1/operator-cards/README.md

- **Security & Stability Baseline** → layers/security-stability-baseline/v0.1/BASELINE.md
  - Anti-patterns: layers/security-stability-baseline/v0.1/anti-patterns/ANTI_PATTERNS.md
  - Operator cards: layers/security-stability-baseline/v0.1/operator-cards/README.md

# Human–AI Interaction Baseline (v0.1)

This repository contains an **artifact-only** baseline for human–AI collaboration in real work:
- **when the AI should explain**
- **when it should be quiet**
- **when it must defer**
- **when it must escalate to a human**

The goal is not “more AI”.  
The goal is **calmer work**, fewer misses, and interactions that feel natural — not exhausting.

## What you get
- A complete baseline doc (v0.1)
- Copy/paste templates
- Simple interaction flows
- Checklists for rollout and day-2 operations

## Quick start
Open:
- `layers/human-ai-interaction-baseline/v0.1/BASELINE.md`
- then use templates in `templates/`

## Scope & boundaries
- No code, no SDK, no product claims
- Interface-neutral guidance (works for chat, IDE copilots, ticket bots, internal tools)

## Versioning
- Baseline: `v0.1`
- Intended as a practical foundation you can extend internally.
